# Plunk It - Obsidian Email Plugin

Send emails and create campaigns directly from Obsidian using the Plunk API, with seamless frontmatter integration for email content management.

## Features

### üìß Email Management
- **Send Individual Emails**: Send one-off emails to contacts in your Plunk account
- **Create Email Campaigns**: Create reusable campaigns with custom styling and frontmatter persistence
- **Update Campaigns**: Modify existing campaigns with new content, subject, and settings
- **Send Campaigns**: Send campaigns to your contact list with automatic recipient filtering

### üéØ Advanced Filtering
- **Client Filtering**: Filter contacts by specific clients or send to all contacts
  - Clients are defined by Plunk contact metadata in the `data` field
  - Example contact data structure:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "5abe1f8f-108c-40c9-85c3-30b60340ae8f",
      "email": "hypernova@tanuj.xyz",
      "subscribed": true,
      "data": "{\"client\":\"hypernova\"}",
      "createdAt": "2025-08-17T02:16:34.809Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-08-17T02:16:34.813Z"
    }
    ```
  - The `data` field contains JSON with client information (e.g., `{"client":"hypernova"}`)
  - You can filter campaigns to send only to contacts from specific clients
- **Subscription Filtering**: Send only to subscribed contacts or include unsubscribed users
- **Dynamic Recipient Updates**: Refresh recipient lists before sending campaigns

  - Perfect for linking to published notes, documentation, or blog posts
- **Campaign Persistence**: Campaign IDs, settings, and configurations are saved in frontmatter

### üé® Styling Options

## Frontmatter Integration

The plugin automatically manages frontmatter properties in your markdown files:

campaignId: "camp_123456789"
subject: "Your Email Subject"
selectedClients: ["all"]  # or specific client names
subscribedOnly: true      # or false
style: "SANS"            # email template style
---
```

### Frontmatter Properties

- **`campaignId`**: Unique identifier for the campaign (auto-generated)
- **`subject`**: Email subject line (used as campaign name)
- **`selectedClients`**: Array of client names to filter recipients (e.g., `["hypernova", "acme"]` or `["all"]`)
