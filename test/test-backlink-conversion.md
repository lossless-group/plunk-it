# Test Newsletter with Backlinks

This is a test newsletter that contains various Obsidian backlinks.

## Regular Backlinks

Here are some regular backlinks:
- [[Agentic AI]] - This should become a clickable link
- [[Machine Learning]] - Another backlink
- [[Obsidian Plugin Development]] - Yet another backlink

## Backlinks with Display Text

Here are some backlinks with custom display text:
- [[Agentic AI|AI Agents]] - This should show "AI Agents" as the link text
- [[Machine Learning|ML]] - This should show "ML" as the link text

## Mixed Content

This paragraph contains a backlink [[Agentic AI]] in the middle of the text, and another one [[Machine Learning]] at the end.

## Code Blocks

Backlinks in code blocks should not be converted:

```markdown
[[This should remain as a backlink]]
```

## Inline Code

Backlinks in `[[inline code]]` should also remain unchanged.

## Links

Regular markdown links should work normally: [Google](https://google.com)

## Conclusion

This newsletter demonstrates how Obsidian backlinks are converted to clickable URLs when sending emails.
